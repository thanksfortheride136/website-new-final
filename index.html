            <p id="section2-text">The Technology Program at Tuckahoe Middle & High School empowers students with hands-on, project-based learning experiences that
               foster creativity, problem-solving, and technical proficiency. Through a diverse range of STEM and engineering electives, 
               students explore 3D modeling, laser cutting, robotics, programming, and electronics, gaining real-world skills applicable in various industries. <br><br>
               
               Middle school students build foundational skills in digital literacy, coding, and engineering design, 
               preparing them for high school courses such as AP Computer Science Principles, AP Cybersecurity, Engineering I & Engineering II. 
               High school students engage in 3D printing, Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, circuit design, and mechanical prototyping, 
               all while using industry-standard tools like Adobe Suite, TinkerCAD, and Autodesk Inventor. With access to 3D printers, a laser cutter, 
               a vacuum former, a bandsaw, and soldering stations, students bring their designs to life, turning concepts into functional prototypes. 
               Whether designing custom musical instruments, programming interactive devices, or exploring digital fabrication, our program ensures that students 
               learn by doing—preparing them for both college and career pathways in technology, engineering, and design.</p>
